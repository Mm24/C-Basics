# Cpp-Basics


C++ is a case sensitive language. Case sensitivity means that your keywords and variable declarations must match the case. Aside from the case sensitivity, C++ also has a defined outline for program code and specific "elements" found in a typical C++ application. These elements consist of:

    Preprocessor directives which are used to have the compiler execute tasks prior to compiling the source code
    using directives which are utilized to indicate which namespaces to include in a source code file
    a function header which consists of a return type, function name, and parameters
    a function body containing the code that performs the actions required of that function
    statements that are contained in the C++ source code file
    comments for documenting the source code for programmers to understand what the code is intended to do
    a return statement that sends data back to the function caller
    curly braces to enclose bodies of statements. Commonly used to denote the body of a function or a flow controls statement such as a for loop

C++ source code also permits judicious use of white space (tabs, spaces, new lines) to create code that is easier to read. The compiler completely ignores the white space, with a small exception concerning if statements that will be covered later. It is highly recommended that you make use of white space to indent and separate lines of code to aid in readability of your source code files.
